# Rent a Gang

This repository contains the project created during the Software Engineering lecture by Thomas Pötzsch and Stephan Stroh.

## Introduction

Finding qualified staff should be easy – for everyone. That’s why we are creating *Rent a Gang*: a tool that helps you find qualified criminals all around the world.

This project aims at creating a MyHammer-like platform for thugs and villains, allowing them to present themselves and their skills.
Users can book certain services for a reasonable price, to make it possible for them to rob a bank or build a cartel.

*Rent a Gang* is a mockery of current activities in the dark web and by all means an art project.
We will mainly use Spring MVC to realize our vision.
